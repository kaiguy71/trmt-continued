/**
 * Registers vanilla block-transformer entries (26.3+) so hoes till and shovels flatten our
 * eroded blocks the same way they do vanilla dirt/grass. This replaces the pre-26.3 approach of
 * mixing into {@code HoeItem}/{@code ShovelItem}, which no longer exist as dedicated classes now
 * that tilling/flattening/stripping moved to the data-driven block-transformer system.
 *
 * <p>Erosion-tracking cleanup for the resulting block change is handled by
 * {@code ErodedGrassBlock#onRemove}/{@code ErodedDirtBlock#onRemove}, since the block-transformer
 * system itself has no post-transform callback hook.
